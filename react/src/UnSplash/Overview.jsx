            <ul className="description-list">
                <li className="description-item"><strong>Developers: </strong>Easily fetch, search, and display stunning images.</li>
                <li className="description-item"><strong>Entrepreneurs: </strong>Utilize beautiful visuals to enhance your brand's online presence.</li>

            <h4 className="section-subtitle">Getting Started</h4>
            <p className="description">
                To access and utilize the Unsplash API, you'll first need to <a href="#" className="link">register</a> if you do not have a pre-existing account or <a href="#" className="link">login</a> if you already have an account. Once you're in, visit <a href="#" className="link">your apps</a>. Then click on "New application" and fill in the required fields to get started.<br />
                To start, your application operates in demo mode, capped at 50 requests per hourâ€”ideal for testing, educational use, and demo apps. Transition to production mode by following the "Apply for Production" guidelines. Upon approval, your rate limit will be raised to its full capacity. Applications have specific <a href="#" className="link">guidelines</a> which include <a href="#" className="link">properly providing attribution for the photographer and Unsplash</a>. 
                All applications must follow the <a href="#" className="link">API Guidelines</a> or contact the official <a href="#" className="link">API team.</a>

            <h4 className="section-subtitle">Libraries and SDKs</h4>
            <p className="description">Unsplash photo API has a range of official libraries and Software Development Kits (SDKs) that make it easy to integrate the API.</p>
            <ul className="sdk-list">

            <h4 className="section-subtitle">Hotlinking</h4>
            <p className="description">
                Unlike typical APIs, Unsplash mandates that the image URLs retrieved must be directly utilized or embedded, otherwise known as hotlinking, following a set of hotlinking <a href="#" className="link">guidelines</a>. Leveraging our Content Delivery Network (CDN) and embedding the photo URLs facilitates better tracking of photo views and popularity. These statistics are then relayed to the photographer, offering insights into their photos' popularity and usage context. Refer to documentation on how to hotlink to <a href="#" className="link">resized images</a>.
